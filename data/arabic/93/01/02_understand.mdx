## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It talks about the character or personality of the greatest prophet, *peace be upon him*, and the blessings and graces that Allah most High bestowed upon him in this world and the next so that he could thank Him by these amazing blessings.

The chapter begins with the swearing upon the loftiness of the magnitude of the prophet, *peace be upon him*. Verily, his Lord has not abandoned him and does not hate him as the disbelievers claim. On the contrary, his destiny, place and affair are elevated in the eyes of Allah most High (Verses 1-3)

Then, the chapter brings the good news of a lot of rewards in the next life, and about what Allah promised him which is a type of miracle, namely the great intercession. (Verses 4-5)

Thereafter, it reminds him of his state when he was a child, how he was an orphan, poor, needy and lost. Then, his Lord provided shelter for him, enriched him and took care of him. (Verses 6-8)

The chapter concludes with advice in three commands that juxtapose to the three blessings mentioned above. These commands are being favourably disposed to orphans, being merciful to the needy and consoling the tears of the miserable, and it closes with order and symmetry of the beauty of language with a magnificent proclamation of originality and loftiness. (Verses 9-11)

## Reason for revelation

The prophet of Allah, *peace be upon him*, complained for he did not stand for night prayer for two or three nights. Then, a woman came, *Umm Jamil*, the wife of *Abu Lahab* and she said:

> O *Muhammad*, verily your devil did not come back and he has left you! I have not seen him around you for two or three nights. 

Then, Allah most High sent the following verses as a reply to the disbelievers, verses 1-3.
