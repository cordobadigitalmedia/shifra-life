## Apply the Verses in your prayer
### Pre-requesite: Memorize the complete chapter in Arabic or at least the first three verses
### Lesson Goal: Visualize the meanings during reading or listening by: 
1. Planning to recite a minimum of the first three verses of the chapter during the non-obligatory sunnah prayers at least three times a day for seven days
2. During each recitation, visualize the meaning of each verse from the previous lessons (close your eyes if needed)
3. Track your performance below and start over if you are not able complete seven days in a row

### Prayer Apply Table Tool

`Include a table with 7 rows and columns for each daily prayer and a date at the beginning of each row. User will complete the date and how many prayers the assignment was done on. Needs to keep iterating until minimum is achieved. Add a feedback box about number of rounds needed and tips`

### Mark Complete button

`(and at the end of each lesson) - if the user did not add his email yet, he will be prompted to do so. From that point any lesson marked as completed will be tracked and shown as a check in the navigation even if the user comes back later`
