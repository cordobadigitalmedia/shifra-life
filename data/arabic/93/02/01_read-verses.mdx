Your Lord shall give you in the next life many rewards, among which are miraculous happenings, mainly in the shape of intercession so that you will be completely content. Ibn Abas said:

> This intercession is for his people until he his content. 

It was narrated that verily the prophet, *peace be upon him*, remembered his people and said: 

> O Allah, my people, my people

and cried. So Allah said:

> O Jibril, go to Muhammad and ask him why is the cause of his crying

Although Allah already knows. Then, Jibril went to the prophet, *peace be upon him*, and asked him and the prophet, *peace be upon*, informed him. Then, Allah said:

> O Jibril, go to Muhammad and tell him, We will satisfy you with your people, so don't grieve.

And in the following narration: 

> There is for each prophet, special requests that are guaranteed to be answered. Hence, all prophets hasten to ask. Verily, I have concealed your asking for your people on the day of judgement.

And another narration, *Khazin* said: 

> First, a sign was carried upon its back, certainly comprising the good of this world and the next with it. So Allah gave him victory in this world, victory upon the enemies and a lot of following and openings and the most elevated of religions, and made his people the best of people and gave him in the next world, general intercession and a praised rank and other than this among the good in this world and the next.

That is, were you not *Muhammad*, an orphan in your youth and Allah protected you with your uncle *Abu Talib* and put you under his care? *Ibn Kathir* said: 

> His father passed away whilst his mother was still pregnant of him. Then, his mother passed away whilst he was six years old. Then he was in the care of his grandfather, *Abdul Mutalib* and the latter passed away whilst he was eight years old. Then, he was taken care of by his uncle *Abu Talib*, and then, protection and victory did not leave him, and he was raised by Allah's power, until Allah sent him the message, above the forty chiefs, whilst *Abu Talib* was worshipping the idols like his people. Thereafter, hardship followed the prophet, *peace be upon him*, and all of this was from Allah's protection and out of care for him.

Did we not find you stray from the knowledge of the religion and it's rules, then we guided you unto it. As Allah says:

```
42:52 مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِي مَا الْكِتَابُ وَلَا الْإِيمَانُ
```

*Imam Al Jalil* said: 

> That is, we found you ignorant related to what you did not know at the time about the rules of religion and then we guided you upon it. 

And it was said:

> He was lost in the outskirts of *Makkah* whilst he was young and Allah guided him back to his grandfather. 

*Abu Hiyan* said:

> It is not benefitting to say that he was taken to guidance after being ignorant as prophets are protected from this. 

*Ibn Abas* said:

> This ignorance refers back to whilst he was lost in *Makkah* when he was young.

It is said:

> He was lost whilst he was with his uncle on the way to *Sham*.
