## Understand by Reading the Verses

### Lesson Goal: Discover and recall the meaning of each verse when you read it by performing the following tasks on each verse:

1. Review and understand the meaning of each verse by showing the explanation
2. Check your recall by hiding the explanation and trying to bring back the meaning by reading the Arabic only
3. Repeat these steps until the meaning comes automatically when you read in Arabic

This is an oath, that is God swears by the fig and the olive due to the blessing in them and their beneficial use. Ibn Abas said:

> It is our fig that we eat and our olive that we press to extract oil.

Ikrima said:

> God swears by the place of the fig and the olive. Indeed, the fig grows abundantly in `Damascus` and the olive in `Jerusalem`

This is a clearer or stronger meaning. Verily, this points towards the fact that God most High is turning to the well known places of the mountain of `Tur` and the safe city. Therefore, His swearing is by these honorable places that He has enobled with revelation and messages from the heavens.

That is, He swears by the blessed mountain where He talked to the prophet `Musa` and this is the `Tur Sinai` where many trees grow and is found blessed excellence.

Khisan said:

> It was named `Sinain` and `Sinai` by it's excellence and blessedness. All mountains where fruitful trees are found are named `Sinain` and `Sinai`.

He swears by the safe city, namely the blessed `Mecca` where whoever enters it, his person and wealth are safeguarded as God most High says:

<showVersesFrom29 ayahs={[67]}>

Do they not then see that We have made a sanctuary secure, and that men are being snatched away from all around them? Then, do they believe in that which is vain, and reject the Grace of Allah.

`Alusi` said:

> This oath is by the blessed place, distinguished by what passed on it frequently. Without any doubt, it refers to the blessed `Mecca` that God protected. Regarding `Tur Sinai`, it refers to the mountain where God spoke to `Musa`. 

Furthermore, regarding the `Tur Sinai` and the fig and the olive, `Qatadah` related that this points towards two mountains. One of them is `Damascus` and the second one is `Jerusalem`. The reference to the fig and the olive is pointing to their land of origin. It was said:

> The purpose behind these two (fig and olive) are the famous trees.

This is the opinion of `Ibn Abas` and `Mujahid`.

The goal with the oath by these things is the exposition about the nobleness of this blessed place and what appears in it of good and blessings of the prophets and messengers.

Ibn Kathir said:

> Some of the `imams` concluded that they are three places. God sent in all of them prophets, transmitting with the highest of determination, companions of the highest laws. The first one is the place of the fig and the olive which is `Jerusalem` where God most High sent prophet `Isa` (peace be upon him). The second is `Tur Sinai` where God most High spoke to prophet `Musa` (peace be upon him), son of `Imran`. The third is the safe city where whoever enters is safeguarded where God most High sent `Muhammad` (peace be upon him). At the end of the `Tawrah`, these three places are mentioned as God came at the mountain of `Sinai`, where He spoke to `Musa` (peace be upon him). Then, to the east, the mountain of `Jerusalem` where God sent the prophet `Isa` (peace be upon him). Thereafter, disclosing the mountain of `Faran` ([Desert of Paran, also spelled `Pharan` or `Faran`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_of_Paran)), referring to the mountain of `Mecca` where God sent `Muhammad` (peace be upon him). They are remembered in the order of the passage of time. God swears by the most honorable first, and then the more honorable from the first and then the most honorable from the first two.

The answer to the oath comes in the next verse.
