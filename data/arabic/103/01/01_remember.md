## Remember the Vocabulary

### Lesson Goal: Recall and Recognize the key vocabulary terms by:
- Reading the Arabic of each word and understanding it's meaning
- Hiding the meaning of each word at a time and recalling it's meaning as many times as needed until you can recall the meaning easily
- Hiding the meaning of all words and recalling all the meanings
- Reading the verses and recognizing the meaning of the vocabulary words in context

*Are there no vocabulary in this chapter?*

Maybe ask users to suggest vocabulary to add.
