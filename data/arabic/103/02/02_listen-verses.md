## Understand by Listening to the Verses
### Lesson Goal: Recall the meaning of each verse when you listen to the verses by performing the following tasks on each verse:
1. Hide the explanation and play the audio of each verse
2. Check your recall of the explanation when you are listening to the audio
3. Repeat these steps until the meaning comes automatically when you listen to the whole chapter in Arabic
