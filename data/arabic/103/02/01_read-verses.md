## Understand by Reading the Verses
### Lesson Goal: Discover and recall the meaning of each verse when you read it by performing the following tasks on each verse:
1. Review and understand the meaning of each verse by showing the explanation
2. Check your recall by hiding the explanation and trying to bring back the meaning by reading the Arabic only
3. Repeat these steps until the meaning comes automatically when you read in Arabic

> Time is what is left. Allah most High swears by it
