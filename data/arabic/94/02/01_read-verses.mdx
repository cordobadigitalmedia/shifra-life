## Understand by Reading the Verses

### Lesson Goal: Discover and recall the meaning of each verse when you read it by performing the following tasks on each verse:

1. Review and understand the meaning of each verse by showing the explanation
2. Check your recall by hiding the explanation and trying to bring back the meaning by reading the Arabic only
3. Repeat these steps until the meaning comes automatically when you read in Arabic

<showVersesFrom94 ayahs={[1]}>

The use of the question particle `أَ` here is for emphasis and repetition. That is, have we not expanded your breast, O _Muhammad_ with guidance and belief, the light of the _Koran_ as Allah most High says in the Koran (6:125):

<showVersesFrom6 ayahs={[125]}>

Those whom Allah (in His plan) willeth to guide,- He openeth their breast to Islam; those whom He willeth to leave straying,- He maketh their breast close and constricted, as if they had to climb up to the skies: thus doth Allah (heap) the penalty on those who refuse to believe.

> And whomsoever God wills to guide, his chest He opens wide with willingness towards self-surrender [unto Him]

Ibn Kathir said:

> That is, we have illuminated him and rendered him wide and ample as Allah expanded his breast. Similarly, He has made the rules for him wide, kind and easy so that he does not leave and does not feel confined.

Abu Hiyan said:

> The expansion of his chest indicates illumination with guidance, his expansion by the reception and acceptance of what was inspired to him

This is also what the majority of scholars say. It was said (related by _ibn Abbas_)

> It is the opening of his chest by _Jibril_ while he was young

That is, we have removed from you a heavy burden or weight

</showVersesFrom94>

<showVersesFrom94 ayahs={[3]}>

That is, that burdened and weakened your back. The scholars of _tafsir_ said:

> The use of the word burden points to the works that undertook the prophet, _peace be upon him_ and removal means forgiveness for him as Allah most High said:

<showVersesFrom48 ayahs={[2]}>

That Allah may forgive thee thy faults of the past and those to follow; fulfil His favour to thee;
and guide thee on the Straight Way

</showVersesFrom48>

> It does not point to forgiveness for sins since the messengers are protected from disgusting offenses but for what he, _peace be upon him_, did out of his interpretation and he was blamed for in situations such as the permission he gave to the hypocrites for staying away from _jihad_ when they exceeded their bounds and took redemption from difficulty at the battle of _Badr_. He was frowned upon for lack of insight. It was said in _Tashil_ that when the sins or wrongdoings of the prophets are described as burden, they refer to the small forgiven actions that distress them and that they are distressed by. They are described as burden because of the strength of their fear of God as mentioned in the following tradition:

> Verily, the believer sees his sins like a mountain about to collapse on him while the hypocrit sees his sins like a fly flying on his nose

Regarding the uttered sound, `أَنقَضَ`, it is what is heard from a loaded beast such as the back of a camel from the heaviness of the weight.

<showVersesFrom94 ayahs={[4]}>

We have raised your affair in the world and the next and we have connected your name with Our Name. `Mujahid` said (that the prophet said):

> I am not remembered except that you are remembered with me.

`Qatada` said:

> God has raised his remembrance in this world and the next. There is no preacher, or listener, or praying person who says or calls "There is not God but God" that he includes with it "Verily Muhammad is God's messenger".

In a narration,

> Jibril came to me and told me: O Muhammad,verily your Lord says: Would you like to know how I raised your remembrance? He replied: God knows best. If I am remembered, you are remembered with Me.

It was said in `Bahr`:

> God connected the remembrance of the messenger with His remembrance, most High, in the statement of belief, the call to prayer, the call to standing for prayer, in the `tashahud`, in the sermon and in several parts of the Koran, obligated the prophets and their people to believe in him (peace be upon him) as was said by _Hasan bin Thabit_:

> His Lord has joined His Name to the name of the prophet (peace be upon him)

<showVersesFrom94 ayahs={[5]}>

That is, after oppression comes victory and after hardship comes ease and relief. The scholars said:

> The messenger of God (peace be upon him) and his companions in `Mecca` faced hardship and oppression due to the harm of the disbelievers to the prophet and the believers. God promised him ease just like He enumerated the blessings bestowed upon him at the beginning of this chapter as consolation for him, as a cure for his sadness and strengthen his hope.

God Most High said:

> Verily the one who has bestowed upon you this amazing blessing, He will grant you victory over difficulty and make your actions clear. He will exchange this difficulty with a forthcoming ease. Hence, it is repeated for the sake of eloquence with the next verse.

<showVersesFrom94 ayahs={[6]}>

That is, victory will come after hardship and ease after difficulty. Therefore, do not be sad or displeased. In a narration, it is mentioned:

> One does not overcome difficulty except with two acts of ease.

</showVersesFrom94>

<showVersesFrom94 ayahs={[7]}>

That is, O `Muhammad` (peace be upon you), when you have finished calling people to God, exert yourself in the worship of the Creator. When you have finished with the affairs of this world, tire yourself with the pursuit of the next world.

</showVersesFrom94>

<showVersesFrom94 ayahs={[8]}>

That is, care and long for what is with God, not what is in this ephemeral world. Ibn Kathir said:

> The meaning is when you have tired yourself with the affairs of this world, seperate yourself from it, exhaust yourself with worship and stand actively in it with an attentive mind, turning your intention and longing to your Lord.
