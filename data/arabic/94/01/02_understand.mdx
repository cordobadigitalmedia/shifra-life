## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It talks about the noble rank of the messenger peace be upon him and his exalted rank with Allah most high. Indeed, the discussion is about the numerous blessings of Allah upon His messenger and servant Muhammad, peace be upon him, such as the expansion of his chest with belief, the illumination of his heart with wisdom and perception and the purification from sins and burdens. The purpose of these reminders is as a consolation for the messenger of Allah when he faced hardship from the lying disbelievers and soothing for his noble sake with what Allah most High blessed him (from light/from many lights?/illumination) (Verses 1-3)

Then, it talks about the raising of the rank of the messenger peace be upon him in this life and the next as he connected his name peace be upon him with the name of Allah most High (Verse 4)

The chapter then describes the calling of the messenger peace be upon him while he was in Makkah with the believers and the suffering from the opposition of the disbelieving liars and hardship therein, consoling him with the nearness/proximity of relief and victory upon his enemies. (Verses 5-6)

The chapter concludes with a reminder to Mustafa, peace be upon him regarding the duty to focus on worshipping Allah after finishing to spread the message and thankfulness/gratitude to Allah for the exalted blessings bestowed upon him. (Verses 7-8)
