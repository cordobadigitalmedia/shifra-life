## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to *Medina* (`مكية`). It talks about the character or personality of the greatest prophet (ﷺ) and the blessings and graces that God most High bestowed upon him in this world and the next so that he could thank Him through these amazing blessings.

The chapter begins with an oath connected to the loftiness of the magnitude of the prophet (ﷺ). Verily, his Lord has not abandoned him and does not hate him as the disbelievers claim. On the contrary, his destiny, place and affair are elevated in the eyes of God most High (Verses 1-3)

Then, the chapter brings the good news of a lot of rewards in the next life, and about what God promised him which is a type of miracle, namely the great intercession. (Verses 4-5)

Thereafter, it reminds him of his state when he was a child, how he was an orphan, poor, needy and lost. Then, his Lord sheltered him, enriched him and took care of him. (Verses 6-8)

The chapter concludes with advice in three commands that juxtapose to the three blessings mentioned previously. These commands are: 

- being favourably disposed to orphans.
- being merciful to the needy.
- consoling the tears of the miserable.

It closes with order and symmetry using the beauty of language with a magnificent proclamation of originality and loftiness. (Verses 9-11)

## Reason for Revelation

The prophet of God (ﷺ) complained for he did not stand for night prayer for two or three nights, that is he did not receive any revelation for several days. Then, a woman came, *Umm Jamil*, the wife of *Abu Lahab* and she said:

> O *Muhammad*, verily your devil did not come back and he has left you! I have not seen him around you for two or three nights. 

Then, God most High sent the following verses as a reply to the disbelievers, verses 1-3.

## Explanation

<ShowVerses sura="93" ayahs={[1,2]}>

God most High takes an oath by the time of mid-morning which happens after the sun has risen and by the night when its darkness has increased and everything has been covered by it. *Ibn Kathir* said: 

> This oath of God most High by the mid-morning is related to what makes it shine, and by the night when everything calms down with darkness and it points to the power of God most High.

<ShowVerses sura="93" ayahs={[3]}>

O *Muhammad*, your Lord has not left you because he has chosen you and he does not hate you because he loves you and this is the reply to the disbelievers when they said: 

> Your Lord has left you

And it is the answer to the oath in verses 1 and 2.

<ShowVerses sura="93" ayahs={[4]}>

The abode of the next life is better for you, O *Muhammad* than the life of this world because the next life is eternal whilst this world is finite and this is why the righteous say:

> O God, there is no life except the life of the next world.

<ShowVerses sura="93" ayahs={[5]}>

Your Lord shall give you in the next life many rewards, among which are miraculous happenings, mainly in the shape of intercession so that you will be completely content. *Ibn Abas* said:

> This intercession is for his people until he his content. 

It was narrated that verily the prophet (ﷺ) remembered his people and said: 

> O God, my people, my people

and cried. So God said:

> O *Jibril*, go to *Muhammad* and ask him why he is crying

Verily God already knows why. Then, *Jibril* went to the prophet (ﷺ) and asked him so that the prophet (ﷺ) informed him. Then, God said:

> O *Jibril*, go to *Muhammad* and tell him: 
>
> > We will satisfy you with your people, so don't grieve.

In the following narration: 

> There is for each prophet, special requests that are guaranteed to be answered. Hence, all prophets hasten to ask. Verily, I have concealed your asking for your people until the day of judgement.

In another narration, *Khazin* said: 

> First, a sign was carried upon his back, certainly comprising the good of this world and the next with it. So God gave him victory in this world, victory upon his enemies, a lot of following, openings and the most elevated of religions. He made his people the best of people and gave him in the next world, general intercession and a praised rank, in addition to more good in this world and the next.

After God made this amazing promise to him, he reminded him of the blessings upon him whilst he was young, so that he thanks his Lord. So, God said:

<ShowVerses sura="93" ayahs={[6]}>

Were you not, O *Muhammad*, an orphan in your youth and God protected you with your uncle *Abu Talib* and put you under his care? *Ibn Kathir* said: 

> His father passed away whilst his mother was still pregnant of him. Then, his mother passed away whilst he was six years old. Then he was in the care of his grandfather, *Abdul Mutalib* and the latter passed away whilst he was eight years old. Then, he was cared for by his uncle *Abu Talib* so that protection and victory did not leave him. He was raised by God's power until God sent him the message, above the forty chiefs, whilst *Abu Talib* was worshipping the idols like his people. Thereafter, hardship followed the prophet (ﷺ) and all of this was from God's protection and out of care for him.

Did we not find you stray from the knowledge of the religion and it's rules, then we guided you unto it. As God says:

<ShowVerses sura="42" ayahs={[52]}/>

*Imam Al Jalil* said: 

> That is, we found you ignorant related to what you did not know at the time about the rules of religion and then we guided you upon it. 

And it was said:

> He was lost in the outskirts of *Makkah* whilst he was young and God guided him back to his grandfather. 

*Abu Hiyan* said:

> It is not befitting to say that he was guided after being ignorant as prophets are protected from this. 

*Ibn Abbas* said:

> This ignorance refers back to whilst he was lost in *Makkah* when he was young.

It is said:

> He was lost whilst he was with his uncle on the way to *Sham*.
