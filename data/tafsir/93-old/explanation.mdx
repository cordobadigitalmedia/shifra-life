Your Lord shall give you in the next life many rewards, among which are miraculous happenings, mainly in the shape of intercession so that you will be completely content. *Ibn Abas* said:

> This intercession is for his people until he his content. 

It was narrated that verily the prophet (ﷺ) remembered his people and said: 

> O God, my people, my people

and cried. So God said:

> O *Jibril*, go to *Muhammad* and ask him why he is crying

Verily God already knows why. Then, *Jibril* went to the prophet (ﷺ) and asked him so that the prophet (ﷺ) informed him. Then, God said:

> O *Jibril*, go to *Muhammad* and tell him: 
>
> > We will satisfy you with your people, so don't grieve.

In the following narration: 

> There is for each prophet, special requests that are guaranteed to be answered. Hence, all prophets hasten to ask. Verily, I have concealed your asking for your people until the day of judgement.

In another narration, *Khazin* said: 

> First, a sign was carried upon his back, certainly comprising the good of this world and the next with it. So God gave him victory in this world, victory upon his enemies, a lot of following, openings and the most elevated of religions. He made his people the best of people and gave him in the next world, general intercession and a praised rank, in addition to more good in this world and the next.

After God made this amazing promise to him, he reminded him of the blessings upon him whilst he was young, so that he thanks his Lord. So, God said:

<ShowVerses sura="93" ayahs={[6]}>

Were you not, O *Muhammad*, an orphan in your youth and God protected you with your uncle *Abu Talib* and put you under his care? *Ibn Kathir* said: 

> His father passed away whilst his mother was still pregnant of him. Then, his mother passed away whilst he was six years old. Then he was in the care of his grandfather, *Abdul Mutalib* and the latter passed away whilst he was eight years old. Then, he was cared for by his uncle *Abu Talib* so that protection and victory did not leave him. He was raised by God's power until God sent him the message, above the forty chiefs, whilst *Abu Talib* was worshipping the idols like his people. Thereafter, hardship followed the prophet (ﷺ) and all of this was from God's protection and out of care for him.
