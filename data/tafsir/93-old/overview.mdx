## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to *Medina* (`مكية`). It talks about the character or personality of the greatest prophet (ﷺ) and the blessings and graces that God most High bestowed upon him in this world and the next so that he could thank Him through these amazing blessings.

The chapter begins with an oath connected to the loftiness of the magnitude of the prophet (ﷺ). Verily, his Lord has not abandoned him and does not hate him as the disbelievers claim. On the contrary, his destiny, place and affair are elevated in the eyes of God most High (Verses 1-3)

Then, the chapter brings the good news of a lot of rewards in the next life, and about what God promised him which is a type of miracle, namely the great intercession. (Verses 4-5)

Thereafter, it reminds him of his state when he was a child, how he was an orphan, poor, needy and lost. Then, his Lord sheltered him, enriched him and took care of him. (Verses 6-8)

The chapter concludes with advice in three commands that juxtapose to the three blessings mentioned previously. These commands are: 

- being favourably disposed to orphans.
- being merciful to the needy.
- consoling the tears of the miserable.

It closes with order and symmetry using the beauty of language with a magnificent proclamation of originality and loftiness. (Verses 9-11)
