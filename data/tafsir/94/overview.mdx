# Decoding Surah al Sharh

## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It talks about the noble rank of the messenger ﷺ and his exalted rank with Allah most High. Indeed, the discussion is about the numerous blessings of Allah upon His messenger and servant *Muhammad*, ﷺ, such as the expansion of his chest with belief, the illumination of his heart with wisdom and perception and his purification from sins and burdens. The purpose of these reminders is to console and soothe the messenger of Allah when he faced hardship from the lying disbelievers for his noble sake with the lights that Allah most High blessed him (Verses 1-3)

Then, it talks about the raising of the rank of the messenger, ﷺ, in this life and the next as he connected his name, ﷺ, with the name of Allah most High (Verse 4)

The chapter then describes the calling of the messenger, ﷺ, while he was in *Makkah* with the believers and the suffering from the opposition of the disbelieving liars and hardship therein, consoling him with the proximity of relief and victory upon his enemies. (Verses 5-6)

The chapter concludes with a reminder to *Mustafa*, ﷺ, regarding the duty to focus on worshipping Allah after finishing to spread the message and gratitude to Allah for the exalted blessings bestowed upon him. (Verses 7-8)
