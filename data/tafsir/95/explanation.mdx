# Decoding Surah al Tin

## Explanation

<ShowVerses sura="95" ayahs={[1]}>

This is an oath, that is God swears by the fig and the olive due to the blessing in them and their beneficial use. Ibn Abas said:

> It is our fig that we eat and our olive that we press to extract oil.

Ikrima said:

> God swears by the place of the fig and the olive. Indeed, the fig grows abundantly in *Damascus* and the olive in *Jerusalem*

This is a clearer or stronger meaning. Verily, this points towards the fact that God most High is turning to the well known places of the mountain of *Tur* and the safe city. Therefore, His swearing is by these honorable places that He has enobled with revelation and messages from the heavens.

That is, He swears by the blessed mountain where He talked to the prophet *Musa* and this is the *Tur Sinai* where many trees grow and is found blessed excellence.

*Khisan* said:

> It was named `Sinain` and `Sinai` by it's excellence and blessedness. All mountains where fruitful trees are found are named `Sinain` and `Sinai`.

He swears by the safe city, namely the blessed `Mecca` where whoever enters it, his person and wealth are safeguarded as God most High says:

<ShowVerses sura="29" ayahs={[67]}/>

*Alusi* said:

> This oath is by the blessed place, distinguished by what passed on it frequently. Without any doubt, it refers to the blessed `Mecca` that God protected. Regarding `Tur Sinai`, it refers to the mountain where God spoke to `Musa`. 

Furthermore, regarding the `Tur Sinai` and the fig and the olive, `Qatadah` related that this points towards two mountains. One of them is `Damascus` and the second one is `Jerusalem`. The reference to the fig and the olive is pointing to their land of origin. It was said:

> The purpose behind these two (fig and olive) are the famous trees.

This is the opinion of `Ibn Abas` and `Mujahid`.

The goal with the oath by these things is the exposition about the nobleness of this blessed place and what appears in it of good and blessings of the prophets and messengers.

*Ibn Kathir* said:

> Some of the *imams* concluded that they are three places. God sent in all of them prophets, transmitting with the highest of determination, companions of the highest laws. The first one is the place of the fig and the olive which is `Jerusalem` where God most High sent prophet `Isa` (ﷺ). The second is `Tur Sinai` where God most High spoke to prophet `Musa` (ﷺ), son of `Imran`. The third is the safe city where whoever enters is safeguarded where God most High sent `Muhammad` (ﷺ). At the end of the `Tawrah`, these three places are mentioned as God came at the mountain of `Sinai`, where He spoke to `Musa` (ﷺ). Then, to the east, the mountain of `Jerusalem` where God sent the prophet `Isa` (ﷺ). Thereafter, disclosing the mountain of `Faran` ([Desert of Paran, also spelled `Pharan` or `Faran`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_of_Paran)), referring to the mountain of `Mecca` where God sent `Muhammad` (ﷺ). They are remembered in the order of the passage of time. God swears by the most honorable first, and then the more honorable from the first and then the most honorable from the first two.

The answer to the oath comes in the next verse.

Then, we threw him in the lowest of the low, for not doing what he was created for, as he is not grateful for the blessings we created for him such him being in the best of form. He does not use what we allocated to him of benefits by worshipping us. Therefore, we will send him in the lowest of the low which is the hellfire.

*Muhahid* and *Hassan* said:

> `أسفل سافلين`: The lowest degree of hellfire.

*Dahak* said:

> That is, we threw him in a humiliating state, which is old age after youth , weakness after strength.

*Alusi* said:

> We extract from the context the state of the disbeliever on judgement day. Indeed, he will be in the most odious and ugliest of forms after he was in the best of forms.

The takeaway for people is the path of taking heed. O mankind, what is the reason for denial after this advice and the clarity of the proofs? He created man from a drop or sperm and perfected him in the most beautiful of forms and created his form. This is the clearest of proofs for the power of God most High and the existence of resurrection and retribution. What is it that calls you towards the denial of judgement day after this proof.

>
> No, He is and I am a witness to it
