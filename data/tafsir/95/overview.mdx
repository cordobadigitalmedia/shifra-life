# Decoding Surah al Tin

## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It talks about two main topics:

- The honor that God most High has given to humankind
- The belief in retribution and reward.

The chapter begins with God swearing by the sanctified `Beqaa valley` ([region to the east of Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beqaa_Valley)) and other honorable places that God most High has favoured with the descent of revelation to the prophets and messengers. These are `Jerusalem`, the moutain of `Tur` and the blessed Mecca, by which God most High swears and has honored man with. Then, He created him in the most beautiful form and most exceptional shape. If he does not grateful with the blessings of his Lord, he will be thrown down to the lowest level of Hellfire.(Verses 1-3)

The disbelievers rebuked by refusing to accept resurrection. Thereafter, are presented splendid proofs that point to the power of the Lord of the worlds, namely the creation of man in the best shape and most beautiful form.(Verses 4-5)

The chapter closes with a clear statement by God with the reward of the believers and the punishment of the disbelievers.(Verses 7-8) In this declaration, one finds the repetition of requital and rewards with the hereafter through the method of emphasis and realisation as well as reproach for the disbelief of the deniers of judgement day.
