## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (مكية). It talks about the character/personality of the greatest prophet, peace be upon him, and the blessings and graces that Allah most High bestowed upon him in this world and the next so that he could thank Him by these amazing blessings.

The chapter begins with the swearing upon the loftiness of the magnitude of the prophet, peace be upon him. Verily, his Lord has not abandoned him and does not hate him as the disbelievers claim. On the contrary, his destiny, place and affair are elevated in the eyes of Allah most High [93:1-4]

Then, the chapter brings the good news of a lot of rewards in the next life, and about what Allah promised him which is a type of miracle, namely the great intercession. [93: 5]

Thereafter, it reminds him of his state when he was a child, how he was an orphan, poor, needy and lost. Then, his Lord provided shelter for him, enriched him and took care of him. [93: 6-8]

The chapter concludes with advice in three commands that juxtapose to the three blessings mentioned above. These commands are being favourably disposed to orphans, being merciful to the needy and consoling the tears of the miserable, and it closes with order and symmetry of the beauty of language with a magnificent proclamation of originality and loftiness.

## Vocabulary

- سجى: increased in darkness

- قلى: hated, detested. Ghabib said: strength of hate

- آوى: keep the one under one's protection close

## Reason for revelation

The prophet of Allah (peace be upon him) complained for he did not stand for night prayer for two or three nights. Then, a woman came, Umm Jamil, the wife of Abu Lahab and she said: "O Muhammad, verily your devil did not come back and he has left you! I have not seen him around you for two or three nights". Then, Allah most High sent the following verses as a reply to the disbelievers: 93:1-3

## Explanation

```
 وَٱلضُّحَىٰ 93:1
 93:2 وَٱلَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَىٰ
```

Allah most High swears by the time of mid morning which happens after the sun has risen and by the night when its darkness has increased and everything has been covered by it. Ibn Kathir said: "this oath of Allah most High by the mid-morning is related to what makes it shine, and by the night when everything calms down with the darkness and it points to the power of Allah most High"

```
93:3 مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَىٰ
```

O Muhammad, your Lord has not left you because he has chosen you and he does not hate you because he loves you and this is the reply to the disbelievers when they said: "Your Lord has left you" and it is the answer to the oath.

```
93:4 وَلَلْـَٔاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لَّكَ مِنَ ٱلْأُولَىٰ
```

The abode of the next life is better for you, O Muhammad than the life of this world because the next life is eternal whilst this world is finite and this is why the righteous say: "O Allah, there is no life except the life of the next world"

```
93:5 وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَىٰٓ
```

Your Lord shall give you in the next life many rewards, among which are miraculous happenings, intercession so that you will be completely content. Ibn Abas said: "This intercession is for his people until he his content". It was narrated that verily the prophet (peace be upon him) remembered his people and said: "O Allah, my people, my people" and cried. So Allah said: "O Jibril, go to Muhammad and ask him why is the cause of his crying". Although Allah already knows. Then, Jibril went to the prophet (peace be upon him) and asked him and the prophet (peace be upon) informed him. Then, Allah said: "O Jibril, go to Muhammad and tell him: "We will satisfy you with your people, so don't grieve."" And in the following narration: 

> There is for each prophet, special requests that are guaranteed to be answered. Hence, all prophets hasten to ask. Verily, I have concealed your asking for your people on the day of judgement.

And another narration:

Khazin said: First, a sign was carried upon its back, certainly comprising the good of this world and the next with it. So Allah gave him victory in this world, victory upon the enemies and a lot of following and openings and the most elevated of religions, and made his people the best of people and gave him in the next world, general intercession and a praised rank and other than this among the good in this world and the next.

Thereafter, after Allah made this amazing promise to him, he reminded him of the blessings upon him whilst he was young, so that he thanks his Lord. So, Allah said:

```
93:6 أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيمًا فَـَٔاوَىٰ
```

That is, were you not Muhammad, an orphan in your youth and Allah protected you with your uncle Abu Talib and put you under his care? Ibn Kathir said: "His father passed away whilst his mother was still pregnant of him. Then, his mother passed away whilst he was six years old. Then he was in the care of his grandfather, Abdul Mutalib and the latter passed away whilst he was eight years old. Then, he was taken care of by his uncle Abu Talib, and then, protection and victory did not leave him, and he was raised by Allah's power, until Allah sent him the message, above the forty chiefs, whilst Abu Talib was worshipping the idols like his people. Thereafter, hardship followed the prophet (peace be upon him), and all of this was from Allah's protection and out of care for him.

```
93:7 وَوَجَدَكَ ضَآلًّا فَهَدَىٰ
```

That is, did we not find you stray from the knowledge of the religion and it's rules, then we guided you unto it. As Allah says

```
مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِي مَا الْكِتَابُ وَلَا الْإِيمَانُ 42:52 
```

Imam Al Jalil said: "That is, we found you ignorant related to what you did not know at the time about the rules of religion and then we guided you upon it". And it was said: "He was lost in the outskirts of Makkah whilst he was young and Allah guided him back to his grandfather". Abu Hiyan said: "It is not benefitting to say that he was taken to guidance after being ignorant as prophets are protected from this". Ibn Abas said: "This ignorance refers back to whilst he was lost in Makkah when he was young". It is said: "He was lost whilst he was with his uncle on the way to Sham".

```
93:8 وَوَجَدَكَ عَآئِلًا فَأَغْنَىٰ
```

We found you poor and needy and we enriched in the world such as we facilitated for you the means of trade... Then, after these three blessings have been enumerated, he is advised with juxtaposing counsels. And Allah says:

```
93:9 فَأَمَّا ٱلْيَتِيمَ فَلَا تَقْهَرْ
```

That is, do not scorn or degrade the orphan, and don't take his wealth. Mujahid said: "Don't despise him". Sufian said: "Don't wrong him by wasting his wealth". What is meant here, be with the orphan as a merciful father, for you were an orphan and Allah protected you.

```
93:10 وَأَمَّا ٱلسَّآئِلَ فَلَا تَنْهَرْ
```

That is, regarding the begging asker who is asking out of need and poverty, don't drive him away when he asks. Don't speak in a rude fashion to him. Give him or reply to him with a beautiful speech. Qatadah said: "Reply to the poor with kindness and softness".

```
93:11 وَأَمَّا بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ فَحَدِّثْ
```

That is, tell people about the favors and blessings of Allah to you, for you talk about the blessings out of thanks for them. Alousi said: "You were a poor and ignorant/lost orphan. Then Allah took care of you, guided you and enriched you. Therefore, don't forget the blessings of Allah upon you in these three ways: Be gentle with the orphan and be merciful with the beggar for you have tasted orphanhood and poverty. Guide the servants to the guided path as your Lord guided you."
