## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (مكية). It talks about the story of the people of the elephant whilst they were proceeding to destroy the Kabah, most elevated. So, Allah repelled their plot by slaugthering them. He protected his House from their authority and oppression. He sent on the army of "Abraham al Ashram" and his soldiers the weakest of His creation through the birds that carried in their feet and beaks small stones. However,  these murderous bullets resulted in demolition and destruction until Allah destroyed and exterminated all of them. This was a historic event that happened in the same year as the birth of the best of creation, Muhammad son of Abdullah, peace be upon him, the year 570 Christian Era. This was amongst the amazing signs or pre-cursors that attest to the truth of prophethood.

## Explanation

```
105:1 أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِأَصْحَـٰبِ ٱلْفِيلِ
```

That is, have we not made it known to you, o messenger? You know with certainty because you have seen with your own eyes what Allah most Great has prepared for the people of the elephant who proceeded with the assault of the sacred house. It was narrated that verily Abraha al Ashram, the king of Yemen, built a church in San'aa and he wanted to turn the pilgrims towards it. A man came from the tribe of Kinana and he relieved himself inside the chuch, one night and he stained the walls with the excrement. Abraha was angry and he swore to raize the Kabah. He came to Makkah with a huge army including elephants, ahead of which was an elephant, mightiest of all of them. When he arrived close to Makkah, its people fled to the mountains, out of fear of the soldiers and the king's power. Then, Allah sent black birds to the army of Abraha. With each bird, were three stones, one in their beak and two in their feet. The bird started throwing the stones on the army and they struck the heads of the people and came out of their rear, rendering them as dead until Allah destroyed and annilihated all of them. Such is their story for people who take heed. Abu Said said: "An important note about this narration is related to how Allah most High executed this action", كيف فعل,  where the focus is not on action done by Allah, it was not said: "الم تر ما فعل ربك". The focus is on the way in which the action was done, on it's amazing appearance or form, which points to the greatness of Allah's Power, and the completeness of his Knowledge and the Honor to His prophet (peace be upon him), for verily, this event is from the premature signs. As it was told, it happened in the same year as the birth of the prophet (peace be upon him)

```
105:2 أَلَمْ يَجْعَلْ كَيْدَهُمْ فِى تَضْلِيلٍ
```

Have we not destroyed them and nullified their plans of destroying the Kabah to ruin and loss

```
105:3 وَأَرْسَلَ عَلَيْهِمْ طَيْرًا أَبَابِيلَ
```

Have we not inflicted upon them and their soldiers, birds that came in groups, each group following each other right away and surrounding them from all sides

```
105:4 تَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ
```

That is, throwing away small stones from dried clay or earth like hard bullets, that do not hit anything except that it causes death.

```
105:5 فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولٍۭ
```

We have transformed them like leaves that are shaken by the wind, that are eaten by beasts and then excreted for we destroyed all of them.

This story points to the miracle of Allah towards the Kabah and the blessings upon the people of Quraish, by the protection of their enemy coming to them, so that it would be incumbent upon them, the Quraish, to worship Him, and to thank Him for these blessings. Furthermore, we find it this story, the greatness and uncaniness of Allah's Power and how he takes revenge on His enemies.

In Al Bahr, it was said:

This is how was turned away a great enemy in the year of the birth of the prophet (peace be upon him), which is a miracle that happened before his becoming prophet. How these birds and their description are from the extraordinary tools and miracles acting as pre-cursors to the coming of prophethood, like it was the case for other prophets. Indeed, Allah destroyed them using his weakest creatures, namely birds which are not classified as birds of prey.
