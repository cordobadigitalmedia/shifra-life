## Understand the Big Ideas
### Lesson Goal: Explain and summarize the topic of the chapter by:
Reading the overview and reflecting on the following questions:
- When were these verses revealed during the life of the prophet *Muhammad* (peace be upon him)?
- What is the main message discussed? 
- What characterises the style of this chapter?
- Are all people at loss? Who are the exception?

## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It comes with a goal of succinct advice, clarifying the reason for mankind's happiness or distress and indicating victory in this life versus loss and perdition.

Allah most High swears by `العصر`, referring to time by which the age of people decreases, and what is in it amongst the types of wonders. It points towards the power and wisdom of Allah most High upon humankind as they are at loss and in perdition except if they are in the following four states:

- Belief
- Rigtheous work
- Enjoining the truth
- Enjoining with patience

And these are the foundations of virtue and religion. Related to this, Imam Sha'fi said:

> If Allah most High had revealed only this chapter, it would have been sufficient for people
