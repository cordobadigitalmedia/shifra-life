## Reflect on the Verses during and after your prayer
### Pre-requesite: Memorize the complete chapter in Arabic or at least the first three verses
### Lesson Goal: Visualize the meanings during reading or listening by: 
1. Planning to recite a minimum of the first three verses of the chapter during the non-obligatory sunnah prayers at least three times a day for seven days
2. During each recitation, visualize the meaning of each verse from the previous lessons (close your eyes if needed)
3. Track your performance below and start over if you are not able complete seven days in a row

### Reflection tool

`Include a text box to keep share/save reflections from questions above. Indicate to Mark complete first time one is done but to keep coming back and adding more reflections related to the same sura here. The last lesson of each surah will always have an "ongoing" icon to express the continuous reflection aspect`

### Mark Complete button

`(and at the end of each lesson) - if the user did not add his email yet, he will be prompted to do so. From that point any lesson marked as completed will be tracked and shown as a check in the navigation even if the user comes back later`
