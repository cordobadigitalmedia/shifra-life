## Understand the Big Ideas
### Lesson Goal: Explain and summarize the topic of the chapter by:
Reading the overview and reflecting on the following questions:
- When was these verses revealed during the life of the prophet *Muhammad* (peace be upon him)?
- What are the main topics discussed?
- What traits in people is Allah most High talking about? Is he only referring to people at the time of the prophet?

## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It talks about those people who find fault in others and destroy them with signs that criticize and lessen, as well as through scorring, mockery and ridicule. All of these are done by the foolish. (Verses 1-2)

These slanderers are engaged in gathering and amassing wealth as if they will abide in this world forever. They think, by their ignorance and forgetfulness, that wealth will last forever in this world. (Verse 3)

The chapter closes with the remembrance of the outcome of these miserable and wretched people. Indeed, they will stay forever in a fire that never goes out, a fire that will break the criminals and all those that encounter it from people, into pieces. Verily, `الحطمة` is the fire of Hell! (Verses 4-9)
